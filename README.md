Viewing collectibles

```
As a collector

So I know what I have and what I'm missing
```

```

Testing Steps:

1. When you login, you are redirected to /users, which lists all users
2. You can get to lists of all items and all brands with the links at the top
3. You can click into a user entry to view their collection
4. You can click into a brand entry to view that brand's catalog
5. You can click into an item entry to view that item's profile, which gives more information about the item
6. Click the checkmark on an item entry to indicate that you have that item
7. Click the heart on an item entry to indicate that you're missing the item and want it
8. If you use a tool like Postman to send a request to http://rumpj2-72842.use1.nitrousbox.com/users/1, /brands/1, or /items/1 asking for a JSON response, you'll receive a JSON representation of that object. This is the beginning of a REST API.
